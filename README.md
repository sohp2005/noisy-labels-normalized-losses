This project is focused on robust learning under noisy labels. The goal was to test how different loss functions handle increasing levels of label noise:

Introduced symmetric noise to the CIFAR-10 dataset.
Implemented and compared:
Cross-Entropy (CE)
Normalized Cross-Entropy (NCE)
Active-Passive Loss (APL = NCE + RCE)
Plotted accuracy vs. noise rate to highlight differences in robustness.
Evaluated performance as noise levels increased.
